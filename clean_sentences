i went on motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
his is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
y a different phone - but not this####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
his item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but i really like i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once (thats when i first used it)####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when i am home, but you cant not hear anything####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it was an inexpensive piece, but i would still have expected better quality####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he microphone also works well, but (according to people i have called) it applifies everything####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacemen####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i have used several phone in two years, but this one is the bes####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i might have gotten a defect, but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
a little expensive, but performance is grea####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when i use this####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the fire red and it's a great color####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hey do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
when i placed my treo into the case, not only was it not snug, but there was a lot of extra room on the sides####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the treo reboots####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointmen####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
can't store anything but phone numbers to sim####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't grea####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i have read other's reviews here but i haven't had any problem with i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
my phone sounded ok ( not great - ok), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
his phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, i could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i love lane, but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (i wanted to see some of her silent work, but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
one more thing: i can tolerate political incorrectness very well, i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the slavic female character was just too much####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
here was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute but if anyone has a question about fort steele, just ask away:)####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i think it was robert ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
not too screamy not to masculine but just righ####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which i really like the star - but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i won't say any more - i don't like spoilers, so i don't want to be one, but i believe this film is worth your time####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i wasn't expecting oscar material, but this?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
his is one i did not have, but i watched it recently on fox movie channel, and was very disappointed####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the scrip####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
his movie was kind of long in length, but i enjoyed every minute of i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
otally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
while you don't yet hear mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
oth films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
his was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
in conclusion, i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but george was well dull####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
im big fan of rpg games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting rpger there is####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
om wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
his film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in cour####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist doctor quinn####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
call me a nut, but i think this is one of the best movies ever####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he best scene in the movie is at the end, but i won't spoil i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
his is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he movie is not completely perfect but 'titta di girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hey are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it's a sad movie, but very good####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i guess i should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the excalibur, but i didn't use my common sense####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
we thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that nigh####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
his was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
restaurant is always full but never a wai####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but i'm not inspired to go back####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
love this place, hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from jenni pho####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers, but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hey could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were grea####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
we've tried to like this place but after 10+ times i think we're done with them####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't each much pasta, but i love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
we got sitting fairly fast, but  ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wai####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
his place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
when i opened the sandwich, i was impressed, but not in a good way####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way fla####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i do love sushi, but i found kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible jo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i started this review with two stars, but i'm editing it to give it only one####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
we aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just don't get i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but i wouldn't eat here again####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
maybe it's just their vegetarian fare, but i've been twice and i thought it was average at bes####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't know what the big deal is about this place, but i won't be back "ya'all"####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||

we still have freedom, but we also have responsibility####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
if we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
listen, we should go back to the room, but first i have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||

and so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, i was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yes -- but i am afraid of being deceived####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
a man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i agree; but god put us on earth to take that risk####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hat is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i accept, but i insist on a wager####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
my chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but  on the contrary, wished him "good luck####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to castle hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as messrs####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
newcombe, i have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
if cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  but my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her accoun####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? no man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
in truth, sir, yes, but  if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
roderick james, you have no more manners than a barber, and i think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and i like you, sir####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
one could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
west was one thing, but this --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
one went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- i thought you knew this --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i hated west, childs hated west, everyone with a goddamn brain hated west but that doesn't mean we killed him####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i ain't gonna pretend i'm not happy west is gone, but you know i couldn't have done this####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
maybe, but that don't make me a killer --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
and i wish i could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
mueller went after him but we held him back####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
levi, i don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i won't let this happen####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||

from dunbar? i hate to break this to you, but i don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
so it's a good plan but it goes wrong; mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he found west, he saw mueller and pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
here are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always nea####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
maybe nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their sergeant's killers####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
now i can't do it, cause i'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
we did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||

you know, eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but  i'd just be lost without yo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
well, they're not starving yet, but they need help####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it never works out because i'm into legs and butts and hair myself####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
so i wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than i am, if you can picture tha####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it's more like the legs or the butt or the hair####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
not completely, but pretty much####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
and i was going to wait a while, but i think####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||

i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||

it's burning me, but i love yo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it's crazy, i don't know where you came from, but i like yo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i can't let you put it in me now but i want yo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||

she's what? fifty? fifty-five? but she hasn't let herself go####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talen####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yeah, but he still has the aggravation####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yeah, but don't tell anybody####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? it's more calculated than sick####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't know how you interpreted that, but i don't think he meant repatriate him####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm due to retire next year and believe me, i need my pension, but if you think i'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hey don't know what it is, but they know####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
didn't want your father to die either, did ya? but it happened####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i will meet you, but only one way -- if robert the bruce is there, and puts his hand on my bible, and swears his loyalty to scotland####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
with cavalry -- not heavy, like the english, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'll invite you again, but your mother thinks i'm crazy####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
is he a man who believes only what others believe? is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? there is strength in yo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i was going to show this to the principal, but i wanted to talk to you firs####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? i'm already late for work --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but i've been putting it off####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
why not? but that's not how things wound up####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i couldn't stand my dad, but i knew if i moved to my mom's i'd never see you again####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i mean, people always say, "you wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
no, but i think something really bad might've happened to us####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think i was a piece of shi####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficul####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hank you, but i hardly think --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to america####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
excuse me, monsieur rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
fine, but i would like to buy your cafe####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
not for sure, monsieur, but i will venture to guess that ugarte left those letters with monsieur rick####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i am moved to make one more suggestion, why, i do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but  have you heard about signor ugarte and the letters of transit?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i wanted to tell you, but i, i didn't care####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hey needed him in prague, but there the gestapo were waiting for him####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm sorry, but  but you, you are our last hope####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i know how you feel about me, but i'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more importan####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i meant to, but something always held me up####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i appreciate it, but i don't accept i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
nothing important, but may i speak to him now?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
ilsa, i don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i hope you'll forgive me, captain, but the present french administration has not always been so cordial####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm sure you'll excuse me if i am not gracious, but you see, major strasser, i'm a czechoslovakian####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
my dear major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
maybe, but it seemed like a good time to star####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
well, rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patrio####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
she went, but she knew you were lying####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i suppose you know what you're doing, but i wonder if you realize what this means?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yes, i know what you mean, but i've already spoken to ferrari####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
miss lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
oh, laugh if you will, but i happen to be familiar with your record####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
oh, but i just told yo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you know, rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the blue parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you know, rick, i have many friends in casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one i trus####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
ain't nothing but trouble for you here####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yeah, but i ain't got time to spend the money i make here####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
okay look, i know you're tired, i know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
what do you want me to say?  that i thought i'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hose salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i think about leaving here, but not to find *them*####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i didn't listen, but you warned me####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
no, but i work there--i like i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you pickin' nothin' but cider apples, peaches--i hope you understand tha####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
we tried the venture capitalist route in the valley, but then again who hasn't up there####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hey say the streets are lined with money down here, but i guess you have to know the secret handshake####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yeah, but come on####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you weren't trying to save anybody but yourself####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
we get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
his might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea i've ever heard####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fas####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't know what you're into with the king pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? we get a big piece####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you know, i hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps i could give you something for her? it's a check####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
she thinks i'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
we can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
sorry about your wallet, but if you think i'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out visa and a bad fake i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
are you pissed about al? i'm pissed too, but i'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
just an idea, but let's just fucking spli####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i understand that, but i had my wallet stolen last nigh####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
no offense, but i've seen you figh####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i hate to do it, but after this, i gotta give you the blowoff####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
elated, but it's the thought, right? oh, this prick's got a sense of humor####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't know him personally, but i've spoken to his boss####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he pay won't be grand, but it's regular####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he casino is nothing but legal thef####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late be####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
we had the same rule at sun city, but it was impossible to check####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
rue, but since this is so, i have no proof that you are really telling me all this####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i read you, lieutenant doolittle, but i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
ah, doolittle, i do have a malfunction on this readout, but i can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, i think about back home, back home at mali####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it's funny, but i kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i know, honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
and i feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean i need to get involved####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hey'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hat's low, but this effects me how exactly?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
not that i don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't know what kind of game you're playing here but i'm out because you are a whack-jo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
like following me around and pestering the people i work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
she may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
no, but i broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what i'm saying?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
not that he cares but the wife and kid migh####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he's a little spoiled, but i know he does####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
plenty, but it was all bad####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
just for the record, i understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
not only are we on again for kiss in detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm sure i can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
okay, i'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, i'm blaming yo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you look a little scrawny, but it's worth a sho####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
of course, but has that ever stopped me before? besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
what else can i do? oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? tickets? jeremiah, do you realize what this means? that you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i realize this is detroit, but i personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as lucifer's kingdom####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
just one, father, but boy was it a doozy####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
look, i want to live, but i don't know where the fuck i'm gonna find two hundred bucks####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i do have a kiss ticket, but not on me####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
ok, but you're not listening to me####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yeah, but if i told her about the other stuff about frank####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
okay, but it has to be a small one####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like tha####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
oh c'mon, i love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause peter needed a kidney####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
h, amber, i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
nice mouth you got there, mom, but i -- i'm not goin' through this again####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
well, excuse me, annette, but i'm braggin' up your kid, here####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
girls check in, but they don't check o####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm sorry, dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "tina," it's seiko####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
she might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he could be playing solitaire, but i don't think so####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
now, i don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hat's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i've gotta five thousand men but no horses####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
is that so?  i used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yes, but i'm not working for you any more####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't know about us, but i know he's-a got something####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you was insulted, but you don't know i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
no, but i shot some ducks####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i've got just the place for a man like you but i'm too busy right now to do any digging####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  look - what do you call your dog?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
no, but my dog he's a got millions of them --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yes, but i'll talk to you about that when we're alone####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
carry out this tragic folly if you will -- but i for one will not be a part of i####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
your excellency, please don't think me silly, but i'd love to have a picture of yo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i -- i may be wrong, but i suspect the secretary of war####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
not that i care -- but where is your husband?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
he did rather well, too, but i had to lead him every step of the way####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it was a nice try, treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
speaking is one thing, treves, but can the man comprehend?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
no, but i certainly shall####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm sorry i could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yes, soon i will start the main spire, but i must finish these columns first, how kind of her####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i can care for you, but i can't cure yo####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you wanted me to speak, but i was afraid####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but i do think that i can get him to speak for himself####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it's all very nice, but i don't see the poin####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? i'll be back later for his bath####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
what does that matter? but you've####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hat's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't know -- but i'm not afraid to try####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
it's not just your livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of all blacksmiths####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i really want to, but tonight's importan####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i want to, but i have to study####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
and i guess on a certain level, i want to break it off, but i feel####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
do i end it? should i give it more time? i'm not happy, but what do i expect? relationships require work####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
you know? agreed? but then i think he is a good guy and####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
which one do you want to be? i prefer to be ruth but i'm flexible####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i mean, i don't mean i'm happy you're uncomfortable, but  yknow####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
oo many guys think i'm a concept or i complete them or i'm going to make them alive, but i'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i don't like it either, but i'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
yes, but i can't love a man named wally####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again, so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but i was really disappointment to be there with him####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
like, okay, but how many times do i think something and it doesn't happen? that's what you're saying, right? you forget about those times####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i know it's not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we're outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to --####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
not a dump, then, but kind of plain####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
i know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting new york?####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but i'm not in this for whooping cranes####$$$$####%%%%%#####|||||
